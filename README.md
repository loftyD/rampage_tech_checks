# Rampage Tech Checks

Rampage Tech Checks is a mobile web app which interfaces with the Rampage API to carry out and view FRA approved Tech Checks on competitors at robot combat competitions across the UK.

## Installation

Download the GitHub repo to run and you can run with PHP's internal web server.

```bash
php -S localhost:8070
```

## Usage

This app will try and talk to the live API for information; but this will not work for security reasons. Expect no data to appear from the API.
